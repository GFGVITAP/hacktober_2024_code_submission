The Program is Done By team Ronin. The Code contains Four sections and all the sections are interconnected and don't
change any of parameter values. the Models are well trained on over 20 epochs with SGD Momentum as optimizer and using Binary cross entropy as loss function (For respective CNN and RNN models).

Better Check the ipynb file before editing the code.. if you want to make some predictions using code or ipynb file make sure to add model.predict(Your data) is the end and have it done. The Output will be 70 - 85 % accurate.
The Ipynb file Doest Not Contain the Full Code since google colab provides limited resourses. The full code can be found in model.py

Requirements : 
1. CUDA
2. Pytorch
3. Tensorflow
4. OpenAi Gym
5. Keras
6. Nvidia RTX above 3050

training_time = 1.4hrs (T4 GPU)
testing_accuracy = 75% (Based On number of iterations chosen)

The datasets cannot be tagged anywhere because they are of huge data say like of 7GiB that requires a lot of internet to upload.. Have Fun and Try the Drug Synthesiser.
